Last updated: 2026-04-12

This file tracks the 16-week project plan and marks what is complete based on the current repository state.

## Status Legend

- `[x]` Complete (verified in repo)
- `[~]` In progress / partially complete
- `[ ]` Not started or not verifiable from repo

## Quick Verification: Annie + Mahim Deliverables

### Annie (Step 1: schema + repo rules)

- `[x]` `data/schema/example.schema.json` exists and defines the dataset example format.
- `[x]` `data/README.md` exists with labeling and privacy rules.
- `[x]` `.gitignore` blocks raw screenshot/image files (`data/raw/`, `data/images/`, `*.png`, `*.jpg`, `*.jpeg`, `*.heic`, `*.webp`).
- `[ ]` Branch/PR workflow steps are not verifiable from local files alone.

### Mahim (Step 2: toy dataset + split + inspector)

- `[x]` `data/manifests/pool.jsonl`, `val.jsonl`, and `test.jsonl` are populated.
- `[x]` Initial toy dataset milestone was completed; current manifests now contain 52 total examples.
- `[x]` `ml/scripts/inspect_dataset.py` exists and validates required fields + split overlap.
- `[x]` `python3 ml/scripts/inspect_dataset.py` runs successfully on current manifests.
- `[x]` Shared private screenshot storage is now verifiable from Drive screenshots (`archive/`, `review/`, `screenshots_v0/`, `screenshots_v1/`).
- `[x]` The reviewed screenshot set has been copied into `screenshots_v1/` and the first dataset freeze is organized in Drive.
- `[ ]` Branch/PR workflow steps are not verifiable from local files alone.

## 16-Week Timeline (Planned vs Current State)

## Phase 0 (Week 0-1): Repo and Workflow Foundation

- `[x]` Data schema path exists: `data/schema/example.schema.json`.
- `[x]` Manifest files exist: `data/manifests/{pool,val,test}.jsonl`.
- `[x]` Dataset validation script exists: `ml/scripts/inspect_dataset.py`.
- `[x]` Annotation QC script exists: `ml/scripts/annotation_qc.py`.
- `[~]` Repo skeleton exists (`app/`, `ml/`, `kg/`, `results/`) but many components are placeholders.
- `[x]` CI workflows exist for repo guards, dataset validation, and annotation QC (`.github/workflows/guards.yml`, `.github/workflows/python-checks.yml`).

Deliverable status: `[x]` Complete (all verifiable items done; skeleton will fill in over later phases).

## Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Dataset Curation

- `[x]` Labeling protocol/rules documented (`data/README.md`).
- `[x]` Initial toy dataset created (10 examples total).
- `[x]` Splits are present (pool/val/test).
- `[x]` Shared Google Drive folder structure exists for private screenshots (`archive/`, `review/`, `screenshots_v0/`, `screenshots_v1/`).
- `[x]` Dataset has been expanded beyond the first 50-example checkpoint (52 total examples in manifests).
- `[x]` The reviewed screenshots have been copied into `screenshots_v1/`.
- `[x]` The first reviewed dataset split is frozen at `pool=37`, `val=5`, `test=10`.
- `[x]` Annotation QC helper script exists and runs successfully on the frozen split.
- `[ ]` Dataset v1 target (200+ screenshots, 500+ QA pairs) not reached yet.
- `[ ]` Dual-annotator agreement workflow (Cohen's kappa >= 0.75) not implemented in repo.
- `[ ]` Bounding box grounding metadata pipeline not implemented.
- `[ ]` KG v1 (~1000 entities + API + app loader) not implemented yet.

Deliverable status: `[~]` In progress.

## Phase 2 (Weeks 5-6): Model Selection and Baseline

- `[x]` Initial model harness exists under `ml/src/axiom/models/` with a shared interface for `train()`, `predict()`, and `export_coreml()`.
- `[x]` Candidate model configs exist under `ml/configs/models/` for Florence, LLaVA Mobile, Qwen-VL INT4, and the executable local baseline (`question_lookup_v0`).
- `[x]` Baseline experiment runner exists (`ml/scripts/run_baseline.py`) and writes reproducible metrics/artifacts to `results/baselines/`.
- `[x]` Baseline results generated and committed (`results/baselines/question_lookup_v0_seed0/`); summary script and results note merged in PR #20.
- `[x]` Model selection rubric is documented in `docs/MODEL_SELECTION.md`.
- `[x]` SwiftUI testbed shell implemented with screenshot import, question input, model picker, run button, answer card, and debug metrics panel.
- `[x]` First real trainable multimodal baseline (`tiny_multimodal_v0`): image-root-aware data loading, PyTorch CNN+embedding model, checkpoint/vocab/architecture artifacts, training runner (`ml/scripts/run_trainable_baseline.py`). Documents Phase 4 export path in `docs/MODEL_SELECTION.md`.
- `[x]` Core ML baseline conversion pipeline implemented: `ml/scripts/export_coreml.py` with `torch.jit.trace` → `coremltools.convert` → `.mlpackage` + accuracy gate.

Deliverable status: `[x]` Complete (all Phase 2 items done; Core ML export pipeline now operational).

## Phase 3 (Weeks 7-10): Selection Strategies and Training Pipeline

- `[x]` Selection strategy interfaces (RAND/UNC/DIV/KG) implemented under `ml/src/axiom/selection/`.
- `[x]` Sweep runner (`ml/scripts/run_selection_sweep.py`) executes 3 strategies x 6 budgets x 3 seeds over the current baseline; KG-guided is honestly blocked pending KG v1.
- `[x]` Per-run JSON results + aggregate `summary.json` + `summary.csv` written to `results/selection_sweeps/`.
- `[x]` Selection strategies documented in `docs/SELECTION_STRATEGIES.md` with proxy rationale and limitations.
- `[x]` Learning curve generation script (`ml/scripts/generate_learning_curves.py`) produces aggregated JSON, CSV, and deterministic SVG plots; documented in `docs/LEARNING_CURVES.md`.
- `[x]` App benchmark mode with CSV logging hooks implemented; single-run and batch instrumentation with deterministic export format.
- `[ ]` KG-guided strategy blocked — requires KG v1 infrastructure (Phase 1 dependency).

Deliverable status: `[~]` In progress (KG-guided blocked on Phase 1 dependency; all other Phase 3 items complete).

## Phase 4 (Weeks 11-12): Compression and Core ML Conversion

- `[ ]` Quantization pipeline not implemented.
- `[x]` Automated PyTorch -> Core ML export pipeline: `ml/scripts/export_coreml.py` traces a trained checkpoint via `torch.jit.trace`, converts with `coremltools.convert`, and writes `.mlpackage` + `traced_model.pt` + `label_vocab.json` + `conversion_report.json`.
- `[x]` Post-conversion accuracy-drop gate (<= 3%): export script compares PyTorch vs Core ML predictions on val/test splits, reports per-split pass/fail with accuracy drop.
- `[x]` Private screenshot-root bootstrap: `ml/scripts/locate_screenshot_root.py` discovers `screenshots_v1/` on macOS; `docs/PRIVATE_DATA_SETUP.md` documents setup.
- `[x]` `export_coreml()` method implemented on `TinyMultimodalBaseline` (in `ml/src/axiom/models/tiny_multimodal.py`).
- `[x]` `coremltools>=8.0` added as `[export]` optional dependency in `ml/pyproject.toml`.
- `[ ]` App integration for `.mlpackage` loading not implemented.

Deliverable status: `[~]` In progress (export pipeline and accuracy gate complete; app integration remains).

## Phase 5 (Weeks 13-14): On-Device Evaluation

- `[x]` Benchmark mode in app implemented with configurable iterations, progress tracking, and session summary.
- `[x]` Instruments profiling runbook: `docs/INSTRUMENTS_RUNBOOK.md` with reproducible protocol, pre-run checklist, output contract, and companion `_meta.json` session metadata export.
- `[x]` CSV logging with deterministic schema and share/export implemented; captures placeholder results now, ready for real Core ML metrics.
- `[x]` Device-profile ingestion and metric-summary pipeline: `ml/scripts/summarize_device_profiles.py` with typed schemas (`ml/src/axiom/results/device_profiles.py`), session folder contract, optional Instruments trace metrics sidecar, honest threshold evaluation, and analysis artifact outputs. Documented in `docs/DEVICE_PROFILES.md`.

Deliverable status: `[~]` In progress (all Phase 5 instrumentation and analysis infrastructure complete; limited by placeholder inference and missing real Core ML model — no publishable device-performance conclusions yet).

## Phase 6 (Weeks 15-16): Analysis and Publication

- `[ ]` Statistical analysis package (power-law fits, paired tests, Pareto analysis) not present.
- `[ ]` Paper draft file(s) not present in repo.
- `[ ]` Demo flow integration and final presentation assets not present.

Deliverable status: `[ ]` Not started in current codebase.

## Next Practical Milestones

- `[x]` Expand manifests from 10 -> 50 examples while keeping question/answer quality constraints.
- `[x]` Add a reusable Python dataset module under `ml/src/axiom/data/` (loader + validation + split stats).
- `[x]` Freeze a balanced reviewed split for the first dataset checkpoint (`37/5/10` over 52 examples).
- `[x]` Add baseline CI workflows for Python checks and dataset QC.
- `[x]` Add Phase 2 scaffold for model selection, baseline execution, and result artifact writing.
- `[x]` Run baseline experiment and commit results + summary analysis (PR #20).

- `[x]` Build SwiftUI testbed shell for on-device testing.
- `[x]` Implement selection strategies (RAND/UNC/DIV) and sweep runner (Phase 3); KG-guided blocked pending KG v1.
- `[x]` Core ML export pipeline + accuracy gate (Phase 4) — `ml/scripts/export_coreml.py` with 96KB `.mlpackage` output.
- `[ ]` App integration for `.mlpackage` loading (Phase 4 completion).
- `[ ]` Quantization pipeline (Phase 4 compression).
